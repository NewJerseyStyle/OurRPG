On the desk was a notebook, clearly recording today's schedule. This filled me with a mixture of curiosity and strangeness. I began to browse the remaining pages of the notebook, discovering that a series of actions and upcoming events were written down for each day. The explanation on the first page indicated that the author was worried I would feel lost if I suddenly returned to my original body, so they prepared this manual.

I didn't know what to do, as it involved whether or not to pretend to be myself during this time and attend the wedding. I remembered a sentence from the note: \"Since the self is limited by finite rationality, therefore, only a part of it can be displayed at a time. So, the true 'self' that cannot be fully and accurately known by others is not the most important thing to be valued in relational interaction?\"","\n","^It seemed like she had also gained new insights from this science fiction-like experience. I took out my own diary and saw two different fonts inside. The newly added part was neat and clear: \"People are connected through imagined futures. The reality of the present does not determine the future. People often create the ending they pursue from a wrong beginning.\" But the last few paragraphs about the wedding seemed hesitant. After all, the wedding was something Karri looked forward to, but participating in it as myself didn't seem like something she was pursuing. She wrote: \"People's feelings change. Maintaining expectations and plans for the future is the basis for maintaining relationships and driving change.\"","\n","^All of this made me start to reflect on the changes in relationships. I realized that it was a matter of choice and responsibility. I decided to accept the reality of this world and bravely face the wedding and Karri. I would attend the wedding with sincerity, doing my best to maintain our relationship. Because I knew that choice and action are the most important parts of our lives, and all I had to do was make choices bravely and bear the consequences. As I gradually understood how this world worked, I also discovered that my abilities and wisdom were constantly growing, which made me more confident in facing future challenges.","\n","^So, I put on my best clothes and got ready to go to the wedding venue. I walked into the hall...","\n","^In my world, the accident didn't happen, the timeline didn't fall into a cyclical knot, and I continued to grow and progress. I learned how to deal with various challenges and difficulties, and I found my place and mission in this world.
