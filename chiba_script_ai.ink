// Chapter One

=== intro ===
Sunlight streamed through the curtains, waking me from my slumber. It was my birthday, and my friends, arriving early, had already started an indoor adventure game to kill time. We were so engrossed in our game that we unwittingly assigned the role of "Demon King" to Karri, who arrived late, throwing her unprepared into the chaotic battle. This left her rather annoyed by our childish game. 

* To soothe her mood, I led her into the kitchen and presented her with her favorite cake. -> cake_moment
* I ignored her annoyance and continued the game. -> game_continues

=== game_continues ===
The game continued for a while, with Karri reluctantly playing along. Though she seemed annoyed at first, her competitive spirit soon took over and she started enjoying the challenge. We all laughed and had a great time.

After the game, we moved to the living room to chat and catch up. Karri seemed to have forgotten her earlier irritation and was in a good mood.

* I suggested we take a break and have some cake. -> cake_moment
* I continued chatting with the group. -> party_ends

=== cake_moment ===
Seeing her excited reaction, a warm feeling surged through me. I recalled the time she hugged a shark pillow at IKEA, a memory that seemed to melt my heart. Karri was jumping around, light and joyful, her hair flowing in the wind. In that moment, I was completely captivated. 

* "By the way, I have a gift for you!" Karri said, pulling out a piece of paper from her bag with a smile. -> proposal
* I continued chatting with the group. -> party_ends

=== proposal ===
"This paper, can you write your last name in front of my name?"
"I do!" I blurted out before she could even remind me.
"However, I still want to know the answers to some questions." She carefully organized her words.
"I love you! Your hands, your face, your eyes, your lips. My heart melts at your smile." I looked at her sincerely.
"Do my other qualities have value in your eyes?" she asked tentatively.
"I wish to possess everything about you!" I responded without hesitation.
"If one day I change, perhaps I will no longer be gentle, no longer beautiful. When I can only envy the beauty of others, will you leave me?" She looked directly into my eyes.
"I promised you I wouldn't leave you." I answered without a moment's hesitation, as if any hesitation would be proof of betrayal.
"Then keep deceiving me, I like listening, and I'm willing to." She said with a smile.

* "I really didn't deceive you." I couldn't help but retort. -> reality_check
* I simply smiled and accepted her words. -> party_ends

=== reality_check ===
However, I felt uncomfortable. While I didn't intentionally deceive her, her words made me realize that I might not have seriously considered this question.
"I really didn't deceive you." I couldn't help but retort.
She just smiled softly, leaving the blank application form behind, and opened the kitchen door. 

* I carefully put away the form, took the sliced cake, and followed her out. -> party_ends
* I tried to explain myself further. -> party_ends

=== party_ends ===
After the lively party, we cleaned up and collapsed, exhausted. But I couldn't fall asleep immediately.
{proposal: "What makes she think I was deceiving her? I was sincere." I couldn't help but ask the ceiling.}
{proposal: I pondered for a while, but couldn't come to a conclusion. My head ached, and drowsiness crept in.}
I don't know how long it took, but when I opened my eyes, it was a bright sunny morning.
"I will never deceive you." I repeated in my heart, taking a deep breath. I understood that love requires sincerity and effort. I couldn't just make promises with my mouth, I had to prove it with actions. I needed to cherish Karri, cherish the love between us, and let her know that my promise was sincere, that it wouldn't change easily.

// Chapter Two

=== chapter_two ===
I woke up to find myself in a strange bed, surrounded by unfamiliar surroundings. I tried to recall everything that had happened, but my memory was blank, as if it had been wiped clean. My heart raced, my breath quickened, and an unprecedented panic gripped me. Now, forget about cherishing Karri, I am in her body, where am I, I didn't even know if I was still alive. Where is my body?

* I fumbled to get out of bed and walked to the window, hoping to find some clues through the window. -> window_view
* I stayed in bed, trying to calm down. -> phone_call

=== phone_call ===
The phone rang, startling me from my reverie. I glanced at the caller ID â€“ it was Jay. I hadn't spoken to him in weeks, not since the accident. I didn't know if I was ready to talk to anyone yet, but I picked up anyway.

"Hey, Karri," he said, his voice gentle. "How are you doing? I've been worried about you."

I hesitated, unsure of how to respond. I hadn't left my room in weeks, hadn't been able to face the world without him. "I'm...fine, Jay," I lied, my voice cracking.

"Karri, I know you're not fine," he said, his voice full of concern. "You've been holed up in that room for weeks. You need to get out, get some fresh air. Let me come over and take you out for a walk or something."

I shook my head, even though he couldn't see me. "No, Jay, I'm okay. Really."

"Okay, well, if you're not going to let me come over, then at least talk to me," he said, his voice persuasive. "I've been thinking about your research on time machines...do you think it's possible?"

I felt a chill run down my spine. Time machine? Karri is working on time machine? I know nothing about this, I have no idea how to respond. "Jay, I don't know," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "I... I haven't thought about it in weeks."

"I know, I know," he said, his voice soft. "I just thought it might be a way to...I don't know, to turn back time or something. To get him back."

I am confused, get who back? "I don't think we can get anyone back with a time machine," I said.

"I know," he said, his voice heavy with empathy. "I just wish there was something I could do to help you, Karri. You're not alone in this. William was a nice guy, we all loved him."

I took a deep breath, trying to composed myself. "Thanks, Jay. Just talking to you helps."

"Anytime, Karri," he said. "I'll let you go, but promise me you'll try to get out of that room soon, okay?"

I cannot believe what did I heard, William is gone, I am dead, this is appalling. "I'll try, Jay. Thanks again for calling."

As I hung up the phone, I felt a sense of emptiness wash over me. So my body is dead, and I am Karri, what will happen next? I cannot imagine. But situation will not get better without taking actions. I must do something.

I looked around the room, taking in the familiar surroundings. I knew I needed to start searching for a way to move forward, to find a way to heal. And maybe, just maybe, I would start with that research on time machines...

* Continue searching the room
I decide to focus my attention on finding the box, leaving the window and its strange glow for later.
-> search_room
* Investigate the window
I'm drawn to the window and its pulsating light. I decide to try and pry open the boards and see what's out there.
-> window_view

=== window_view ===
The view outside was familiar. I couldn't remember anything, I could barely even remember my own name. I couldn't understand what was happening, who I was, where I was, or why I was here.
Turning my head, I noticed a photo on the table. Her eyes were bright, her smile warm. It was Karri, I couldn't be mistaken. Suddenly, I realized: perhaps I had switched bodies with Karri. With this realization, I began to search the room for possible clues.

* I opened the closet, and the clothes hanging inside were completely foreign to me. -> search_room
* I walked into the kitchen, facing a cabinet full of items, but I couldn't remember their names or how to use them. -> search_room

=== search_room ===
A deep sense of despair washed over me. I didn't know what to do. If I was really Karri, then where was the real Karri?
Just then, the phone rang. I found the phone in the living room, and the voice on the other end was Zane's. He said, "Hey, how are you? Are you still immersed in William's passing? It's been a tough year for everyone. You've been staying at William's house for quite some time now, keeping yourself shut off from the world. I hope you don't always bear the burden alone."

* My heart skipped a beat. I was dead? But I was alive in Karri's body? This was my new life. -> loss_acceptance
* I ignored the phone call and continued searching the room. -> loss_acceptance

=== loss_acceptance ===
Lying down again, I felt both physically and mentally exhausted. My thoughts swirled around past actions and ideas, making me feel extremely uncomfortable.

I began to take deep breaths, trying to relax my body and thoughts. Closing my eyes, focusing on my breath, I realized the need to accept my past, learn from it, and gain experience and lessons. I began to imagine the valuable lessons I had learned from this experience, such as valuing others' feelings and needs more, and learning to see things from their perspective.

These thoughts brought me a sense of greater peace and tranquility. I gradually realized that what happened in the past has already happened, and now what I need to do is learn and grow from it, becoming more mature and wise. Eventually, I drifted off to sleep.

// Chapter Six

=== chapter_six ===
On the fourth day, the food in the refrigerator was depleted. I opened the freezer, hoping to find something to defrost. Unexpectedly, I discovered a strange storage device in the corner. It appeared to be connectable to the computer.

As I delved into the documents within the storage device, I uncovered its secret. This was the operating manual for the legendary machine capable of transmitting consciousness.

"Having found this document, follow the instructions and send yourself back to your original world..." the document stated. However, I was filled with doubt. I wasn't sure if I should activate the device under the bed. I didn't know why I should stay in this world, nor why I should return to my original world. I didn't know the right choice, but I still remembered my desire to let her know in that world that my promise was sincere. I wondered if it was justified to disrupt what she was doing in this world. 

* I slowly opened the box and activated the device. -> return_home
* I decided to stay in this world and continue living as Karri. -> stay_in_this_world


=== stay_in_this_world ===
After much deliberation, I decided to stay in this world and continue living as Karri. I didn't fully understand what had happened or why I had switched places with her, but I felt a strong desire to protect her and ensure her happiness in this world.

I immersed myself in Karri's life, learning about her job, her friends, and her daily routines. It wasn't always easy, as I had to adjust to a completely different way of living. But I was determined to make the best of the situation and to honor the trust that had been placed in me.

As the days passed, I grew more comfortable in this new role. I even began to appreciate the unique opportunities and experiences that this world had to offer. I felt a sense of purpose and fulfillment that I had never known in my own world.

Ultimately, I decided that staying in this world was the right choice for me. I would continue to learn and grow, and to make the most of the life that had been entrusted to me. With a renewed sense of purpose and determination, I embraced this new chapter of my life.

-> END

=== return_home ===
Finally, following the instructions in the document, I slowly opened the box and activated the device...

When I woke up again, I found myself in my own room. On the desk was a notebook, clearly recording today's schedule. This filled me with a mixture of curiosity and strangeness. I began to browse the remaining pages of the notebook, discovering that a series of actions and upcoming events were written down for each day. The explanation on the first page indicated that the author was worried I would feel lost if I suddenly returned to my original body, so they prepared this manual. There were torn marks on the notes, perhaps there were instructions for each day before, just in case I suddenly decided to activate the device and return.

I felt like I was being taken care of with special attention. My heart raced, and at the same time, I felt guilty for my negligence. Leaving that world without leaving any explanation was such a wrong thing to do.

I could feel a tingling sensation spreading across my spine. Surprise and confusion intertwined within me, but there was also a sense of wonderful security. Because I knew that by checking this notebook, I could grasp the current situation, not get lost, or make wrong decisions.

When I saw the note that said I would be having a wedding with Karri in the afternoon, I felt a surge of excitement, followed by endless entanglement. I didn't know what to do, as it involved whether or not to pretend to be myself during this time and attend the wedding. I remembered a sentence from the note: "Since the self is limited by bounded rationality, therefore, only a part of it can be displayed at a time. So, the true 'self' that cannot be fully and accurately known by others is not the most important thing to be valued in relational interaction?"

It seemed like she had also gained new insights from this science fiction-like experience. I took out my own diary and saw two different fonts inside. The newly added part was neat and clear: "People are connected through imagined futures. The reality of the present does not determine the future. People often create the ending they pursue from a wrong beginning." But the last few paragraphs about the wedding seemed hesitant. After all, the wedding was something Karri looked forward to, but participating in it as myself didn't seem like something she was pursuing. She wrote: "People's feelings change. Maintaining expectations and plans for the future is the basis for maintaining relationships and driving change."

All of this made me start to reflect on the changes in relationships. I realized that it was a matter of choice and responsibility. I decided to accept the reality of this world and bravely face the wedding and Karri. I would attend the wedding with sincerity, doing my best to maintain our relationship. Because I knew that choice and action are the most important parts of our lives, and all I had to do was make choices bravely and bear the consequences. As I gradually understood how this world worked, I also discovered that my abilities and wisdom were constantly growing, which made me more confident in facing future challenges.

So, I put on my best clothes and got ready to go to the wedding venue. I walked into the hall...

In my world, the accident didn't happen, the timeline didn't fall into a cyclical knot, and I continued to grow and progress. I learned how to deal with various challenges and difficulties, and I found my place and mission in this world. I am grateful to her in that world, because she made me realize what is truly important in life, and helped me become a better person.
