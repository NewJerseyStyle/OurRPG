# Plot
## Chapter One

Sunlight streamed through the curtains, waking me from my slumber. It was my birthday, and my friends, arriving early, had already started an indoor adventure game to kill time. We were so engrossed in our game that we unwittingly assigned the role of "Demon King" to Karri, who arrived late, throwing her unprepared into the chaotic battle. This left her rather annoyed by our childish game.

To soothe her mood, I led her into the kitchen and presented her with her favorite cake. Seeing her excited reaction, a warm feeling surged through me. I recalled the time she hugged a shark pillow at IKEA, a memory that seemed to melt my heart. Karri was jumping around, light and joyful, her hair flowing in the wind. In that moment, I was completely captivated.

"By the way, I have a gift for you!" Karri said, pulling out a piece of paper from her bag with a smile. "This paper, can you write your last name in front of my name?"

"I do!" I blurted out before she could even remind me.

"However, I still want to know the answers to some questions." She carefully organized her words.

"I love you! Your hands, your face, your eyes, your lips. My heart melts at your smile." I looked at her sincerely.

"Do my other qualities have value in your eyes?" she asked tentatively.

"I wish to possess everything about you!" I responded without hesitation.

"If one day I change, perhaps I will no longer be gentle, no longer beautiful. When I can only envy the beauty of others, will you leave me?" She looked directly into my eyes.

"I promised you I wouldn't leave you." I answered without a moment's hesitation, as if any hesitation would be proof of betrayal.

"Then keep deceiving me, I like listening, and I'm willing to." She said with a smile.

However, I felt uncomfortable. While I didn't intentionally deceive her, her words made me realize that I might not have seriously considered this question.

"I really didn't deceive you." I couldn't help but retort.

She just smiled softly, leaving the blank application form behind, and opened the kitchen door.

I carefully put away the form, took the sliced cake, and followed her out.

After the lively party, we cleaned up and collapsed, exhausted. But I couldn't fall asleep immediately.

"Why did I say I was deceiving her? I was sincere." I couldn't help but ask the ceiling.

I pondered for a while, but couldn't come to a conclusion. My head ached, and drowsiness crept in.

I don't know how long it took, but when I opened my eyes, it was a bright sunny morning.

"I didn't deceive you." I repeated in my heart, taking a deep breath. I understood that love requires sincerity and effort. I couldn't just make promises with my mouth, I had to prove it with actions. I needed to cherish Karri, cherish the love between us, and let her know that my promise was sincere, that it wouldn't change easily.

## Chapter Two

I woke up to find myself in a strange bed, surrounded by unfamiliar surroundings. I tried to recall everything that had happened, but my memory was blank, as if it had been wiped clean. My heart raced, my breath quickened, and an unprecedented panic gripped me. Now, forget about cherishing Karri, I didn't even know if I was still alive.

I fumbled to get out of bed and walked to the window, hoping to find some clues through the window. The view outside was familiar. I couldn't remember anything, I could barely even remember my own name. I couldn't understand what was happening, who I was, where I was, or why I was here.

Turning my head, I noticed a photo on the table. Her eyes were bright, her smile warm. It was Karri, I couldn't be mistaken. Suddenly, I realized: perhaps I had switched bodies with Karri. With this realization, I began to search the room for possible clues.

I opened the closet, and the clothes hanging inside were completely foreign to me. I only recognized the blue dress she wore yesterday. Then, I walked into the kitchen, facing a cabinet full of items, but I couldn't remember their names or how to use them. A deep sense of despair washed over me. I didn't know what to do. If I was really Karri, then where was the real Karri?

Just then, the phone rang. I found the phone in the living room, and the voice on the other end was Zane's. He said, "Hey, how are you? Are you still immersed in William's passing? It's been a tough year for everyone. You've been staying at William's house for quite some time now, keeping yourself shut off from the world. I hope you don't always bear the burden alone."

My heart skipped a beat. I was dead? But I was alive in Karri's body? This was my new life. But I should have lived for a few more months after my birthday, then died for a whole year. But I have no memory, how is that possible? Ever since I died half a year ago, Karri has been staying home alone. Perhaps this is a good thing, at least I don't have to worry about anyone discovering my predicament. Or should I talk to someone about it?

I crouched on the floor, I don't know if I was crying, but I could feel something wet on my face. I don't know how long it took, but finally I felt some strength in my body, and my stomach started to growl. I dragged my tired body to the kitchen to find something to eat, afraid that if Karri came back and found her body messed up by me, it would be terrible. Even though it was a delusion, it was the only hope that could sustain me now.

There was a sticker on the fridge with a combination of meaningless symbols, I didn't know what it meant. I found some things I could eat, and after finishing, I realized it was already evening. Thinking that someone might come looking for me, I had to learn more about Karri's life, lest I be discovered as abnormal. I carefully examined the decorations and objects in the living room, trying to find more clues. But everything was so foreign, it only made me feel worse. Every object reminded me that I was an outsider, and I felt overwhelmed, wanting to escape everything.

I felt as if my spirit had been drained. Too much had happened today, I was completely disoriented, and I didn't want to deal with anything anymore. I just wanted to go back to bed, maybe when I woke up everything would be back to normal, or maybe this was a dream within a dream.

## Chapter Three

The next morning, as the dawn light seeped through the cracks in the curtains, I slowly opened my eyes and found myself still in my bedroom. This room, once so familiar, now felt strangely alien, leaving a sense of unease in my heart. I knew it would take time to truly adapt to all of this, to find my own world again. In the meantime, I had to do my best to play the role of Karri, so that when she returned to her own body, she could seamlessly integrate back into her life.

Gazing at the cloudy sky outside the window, a heavy weight settled in my chest. I sat there quietly for a long time. Until a rumbling in my stomach reminded me of the hunger pangs that were gnawing at me.

I went to the kitchen and living room, searching for something to fill my stomach. A caramel Swiss roll appeared before me. Though it was my favorite, I took a bite and found the taste unappealing, mirroring my current predicament.

Looking around, the small, cozy living room was filled with memories. The sofa, the table, the TV, and the cabinets. The empty case of the movie "Your Name" on the table reminded me of our plans to watch it together. Maybe this was just a dream, but it clearly wasn't. I couldn't live in a dream without eating or drinking, at least I should wake up from hunger.

A notebook lay on the table. Curiosity compelled me to open it and read. The contents shocked me, casting a deep shadow of doubt over Karri's thought experiments. I felt utterly foreign to her words, deeply shaken by her views on "self." Could "self" truly be a form of deception?

The notebook read: "If a solitary person in an isolated space communicates with others through a phone, can they express the 'self' in the diary based on the meaning attributed to things in the diary and the emotions revealed in brief conversations? If they can, then 'self' may just be an illusion composed of forty-nine messages and sensations." Perhaps I could learn more about her thoughts from this notebook, which might help me with my current situation.

The notebook concluded: "Since self is limited by finite rationality, it can only reveal a small part of itself at a time. Therefore, an artificial intelligence that absorbs a person's past experiences can also maximally restore the person's self, allowing that person to live forever in the digital world." Was I, the one reading this, just a consciousness reconstructed from my memories by her? Had she already understood the nature of consciousness, and I was just a string of information? Had I truly been deceived by myself?

My thoughts were in turmoil, and I couldn't continue to dwell on them. Thankfully, I wasn't the kind of person who excelled at deep thinking, so I put the notebook away. I noticed the beautiful bow on the cover. It was a swap diary I had given Karri as a gift. But why was there no content in the swap diary, only these notes? And the notebook was much thinner than when I gave it to her. I couldn't understand the reason.

Putting down the notebook, I began to explore the room, carefully examining the desk, computer, and bookshelf, hoping to find some clues. Since I didn't know the computer password, I started by looking for Karri's diary.

I flipped through Karri's diary and books, and was surprised to find that she had a strong interest in time travel and quantum physics. She seemed to be working on a project aimed at changing the past, trying to achieve a cross-temporal exchange of consciousness, or more precisely, an exchange of brain consciousness information. My head spun, and I couldn't help but rub my temples. Should I express my admiration for her courage and perseverance, or should I be angry at myself for not understanding those complex theories?

Just then, the phone in the living room rang. It was Jay calling, trying to bring me some comfort.

## Chapter Four

As night fell, I gradually grew accustomed to my surroundings. I cautiously searched for any possible clues, trying to unravel the complex truth behind this absurd play. Despite gathering a large amount of information, it still felt like scattered pearls, unable to be woven into a coherent story. The fatigue of my body and the pressure on my mind were like invisible burdens, weighing heavily on my shoulders.

In Jay's greetings, I detected his concern and support. He asked about my well-being, mentioning my previous practice: "Are you feeling better? The way you spoke the other day didn't sound like yourself. You said it was to practice speaking with one mind. Have you made any progress?" Jay's voice was gentle, almost as if Karri had anticipated my appearance here in this way and prepared for my transformation.

I fell into contemplation. Karri had confined herself to this room, rarely going out. This was precisely the experiment she mentioned in her notes, communicating with the world through the phone. Was she using her own life as a subject for her experiment? Then who was I now? Was I One Mind, or a replica constructed from my diary by her? Doubts clouded my mind.

I replied, "Well, I'm very fluent now!" In reality, I didn't need to practice at all.

Jay brought up my past time machine project, saying, "I remember you were working on a time machine project, hoping to save that lost love."

"Yes, I was just reading my own notes."

"Ah, can I come visit you? You said a few days ago that you had a breakthrough, but I was busy... you know, my family wants you to see a psychiatrist... I'll go and arrange those procedures for you. I know you want to make sure the treatment doesn't affect your research. I support you." Hearing Jay's concern, my heart tightened. I understood even more why Karri was so eager to change the past, why she was so dedicated to her research in quantum physics. Perhaps some things, once let go, can never be retrieved.

"Uh, I..." Faced with this situation, I had no strategy. I could only find an excuse to pretend to be sick, trying to hide my predicament. "I... I don't feel well, I don't want to see anyone."

"Should I take you to the doctor?"

"No, I'm mentally tired. I just want to be quiet for a while."

"Then... I won't bother you. But you might not have received the message. My family will be back in Hong Kong in a few days, and they will take you to see a psychiatrist." Jay informed me.

After hanging up the phone, my anxiety grew even stronger. I was afraid that if I confessed my true identity, no one would believe me, and it might lead to further misunderstandings of my situation. If one day I returned to my original world, and Karri returned here, how would she face all this? I had to be more careful, to play the role of Karri even harder. This was not just for myself, but for her as well.

I tried to browse through the books I found on the bookshelf: "The Twilight of the Idols," "Simulacra and Simulation," "The Selfish Gene," "The Sociological Imagination," "Imagined Communities." Their titles seemed profound and enigmatic, most of them were incomprehensible to me. Unconsciously, I fell asleep on the floor with a book in my arms. Waking up, I was still uncomfortable from sleeping on the floor. I caught a glimpse of the mysterious box under the bed, but didn't investigate further. I quickly climbed onto the bed and fell back asleep.

Until dawn, I welcomed a new day in bed once again.

## Chapter Five

Today marked my third day here. The gentle patter of rain outside offered a slight sense of relief. I tidied up the profound books scattered on the floor, then opened Karri's diary, where I found clues about her research on the time machine, which she started after One Mind's unexpected passing.  Zane called, his voice laced with pity for Karri and concern for her current state. I tried my best to remain composed, only mentioning the memories recorded in the diary, pretending to be Karri. I wanted Zane to think I had begun to let go, no longer obsessed with completing the time machine.

I wanted to find more information on the computer, but I didn't know the password. I tried various possible combinations while pondering other ways to unlock it. Suddenly, my gaze fell on the doorway. I remembered seeing a set of unfamiliar characters on the refrigerator. I immediately ran to the refrigerator, found those letters, and entered them sequentially on the computer. It was the correct password. The computer beeped, successfully logging me in. I was ecstatic, as I could now access Karri's past browser history and notes.

I discovered a series of web pages containing concepts and technologies I had never encountered before. I tried to identify keywords in the articles and consult encyclopedia websites to understand the situation as best as I could. It turned out that Karri hadn't finished designing the time machine, but instead proved the limitations and theoretical basis of quantum teleportation. Based on the principle of quantum teleportation, she attempted to send signals to points before and after the timeline, but couldn't guarantee the recipient of the signal. Ultimately, she used a specific brain neural structure as the receiving device to ensure the recipient, resulting in the creation of a machine that transmitted consciousness. Perhaps Karri sent her own consciousness to the past and changed something. Maybe it was this intervention in the past that led to my presence here. We've created a knot in the straight line of time's development. Who knows what impact this will have on the entire space-time continuum? What if we fall into an endless loop?

Suddenly, I felt a sense of fear. This fear was different from the fear I had previously felt about my own situation. It was a vague, distant unease, like I had done something terrible but luckily no one knew. My immediate priority was to find the control panel and see if I could repair the temporal chaos Karri created, returning to my own life. Karri's notes were a great help. Perhaps she anticipated my attempt to find a way back and was guiding me all along. But I couldn't help but sympathize with Karri. If everything she did was to bring me and her together in that world, would activating the device disrupt her plan? Maybe the best choice would be to live in this world as her? At this moment, when I needed divine guidance the most, it didn't appear.

Perhaps if I visited the psychiatrist, everyone wouldn't doubt my strangeness. It wouldn't be impossible to settle here.

I felt my attention becoming increasingly scattered, and my body growing weary. I realized I needed to rest, so I went into the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, and took out an apple and a glass of milk. The simple food brought me comfort and satisfaction. I sat at the dining table, slowly enjoying these delicacies, allowing my thoughts to relax. Afterward, I abandoned thinking.

After dinner, I returned to the bedroom and lay down on the bed. I turned off the lights, making the room even darker. Closing my eyes, I immersed myself in the darkness. The sound of rain enveloped me, creating a relaxed and peaceful atmosphere. My breathing became deeper and steadier.

I don't know how long I slept, but when I opened my eyes again, the room was already bright. I felt energized and clear-headed. With renewed energy and clarity of thought, I returned to the computer and continued to review the notes. This time, my thinking was clearer, and I was able to focus on reading and understanding the content.

The notes mentioned "arXiv: Quantum Systems; Incomputable." I studied it for a long time but couldn't understand it. It seemed to be a complex mathematical theory. Why did the notes say that a single person's perspective could never make the best choice? Why, even with a quantum computer, could an individual not predict the future of two people at the moment? Perhaps what we need is not prediction, but communication—even if it's not the best choice, it's a choice we're willing to bear the consequences for?

I suddenly realized that I had been looking at the problem from my own perspective, without trying to see things from her point of view. I realized I might have caused Karri unnecessary trouble and pain. I hoped I could be more attentive to others' feelings and needs. Perhaps what she meant by saying I was deceiving her was that I hadn't seriously considered the consequences and made decisions based solely on fantasies and predictions of beautiful dreams?

Lying down again, I felt both physically and mentally exhausted. My thoughts swirled around past actions and ideas, making me feel extremely uncomfortable.

I began to take deep breaths, trying to relax my body and thoughts. Closing my eyes, focusing on my breath, I realized the need to accept my past, learn from it, and gain experience and lessons. I began to imagine the valuable lessons I had learned from this experience, such as valuing others' feelings and needs more, and learning to see things from their perspective.

These thoughts brought me a sense of greater peace and tranquility. I gradually realized that what happened in the past has already happened, and now what I need to do is learn and grow from it, becoming more mature and wise. Eventually, I drifted off to sleep.

## Chapter Six

On the fourth day, the food in the refrigerator was depleted. I opened the freezer, hoping to find something to defrost. Unexpectedly, I discovered a strange storage device in the corner. It appeared to be connectable to the computer.

As I delved into the documents within the storage device, I uncovered its secret. This was the operating manual for the legendary machine capable of transmitting consciousness.

"Having found this document, follow the instructions and send yourself back to your original world..." the document stated. However, I was filled with doubt. I wasn't sure if I should activate the device under the bed. I didn't know why I should stay in this world, nor why I should return to my original world. I didn't know the right choice, but I still remembered my desire to let her know in that world that my promise was sincere. I wondered if it was justified to disrupt what she was doing in this world.

Finally, following the instructions in the document, I slowly opened the box and activated the device...

When I woke up again, I found myself in my own room. On the desk was a notebook, clearly recording today's schedule. This filled me with a mixture of curiosity and strangeness. I began to browse the remaining pages of the notebook, discovering that a series of actions and upcoming events were written down for each day. The explanation on the first page indicated that the author was worried I would feel lost if I suddenly returned to my original body, so they prepared this manual. There were torn marks on the notes, perhaps there were instructions for each day before, just in case I suddenly decided to activate the device and return.

I felt like I was being taken care of with special attention. My heart raced, and at the same time, I felt guilty for my negligence. Leaving that world without leaving any explanation was such a wrong thing to do.

I could feel a tingling sensation spreading across my spine. Surprise and confusion intertwined within me, but there was also a sense of wonderful security. Because I knew that by checking this notebook, I could grasp the current situation, not get lost, or make wrong decisions.

When I saw the note that said I would be having a wedding with Karri in the afternoon, I felt a surge of excitement, followed by endless entanglement. I didn't know what to do, as it involved whether or not to pretend to be myself during this time and attend the wedding. I remembered a sentence from the note: "Since the self is limited by finite rationality, therefore, only a part of it can be displayed at a time. So, the true 'self' that cannot be fully and accurately known by others is not the most important thing to be valued in relational interaction?"

It seemed like she had also gained new insights from this science fiction-like experience. I took out my own diary and saw two different fonts inside. The newly added part was neat and clear: "People are connected through imagined futures. The reality of the present does not determine the future. People often create the ending they pursue from a wrong beginning." But the last few paragraphs about the wedding seemed hesitant. After all, the wedding was something Karri looked forward to, but participating in it as myself didn't seem like something she was pursuing. She wrote: "People's feelings change. Maintaining expectations and plans for the future is the basis for maintaining relationships and driving change."

All of this made me start to reflect on the changes in relationships. I realized that it was a matter of choice and responsibility. I decided to accept the reality of this world and bravely face the wedding and Karri. I would attend the wedding with sincerity, doing my best to maintain our relationship. Because I knew that choice and action are the most important parts of our lives, and all I had to do was make choices bravely and bear the consequences. As I gradually understood how this world worked, I also discovered that my abilities and wisdom were constantly growing, which made me more confident in facing future challenges.

So, I put on my best clothes and got ready to go to the wedding venue. I walked into the hall...

In my world, the accident didn't happen, the timeline didn't fall into a cyclical knot, and I continued to grow and progress. I learned how to deal with various challenges and difficulties, and I found my place and mission in this world. I am grateful to her in that world, because she made me realize what is truly important in life, and helped me become a better person.

# 劇情設計
## 第一章
陽光透過窗簾灑進房間，喚醒了我沉睡的意識。今天是我的生日派對，我們一群早到的好友無聊開始了一場室內冒險遊戲，試圖打發時間。然而，我們玩得忘乎所以，將遲到的凱晴賦予了「魔王」的角色讓她毫無準備地捲入了混亂的打鬥中，讓她對我們幼稚的遊戲倍感生氣。

為了安撫她的情緒，我將她帶進了廚房，展示了她最喜歡的蛋糕。看到她興奮的樣子，我心頭湧上一股暖流。回想起上一次她在IKEA家居抱著鯊魚抱枕時的模樣，那情景彷彿要將我的心融化了。凱晴輕盈愉悅地跳躍著，頭髮隨風飄揚，那一刻，我被深深吸引。

「對了，我有禮物給你哦！」凱晴笑著從包包裡拿出一張紙，「這張紙，可以把你的姓寫在我名字前面嗎？」

「我願意！」還沒等到她提醒，我便迫不及待地說出口。

「不過，我還想了解一些問題的答案。」她小心翼翼地組織語言。

「我愛你！你的手、你的臉、你的雙眼、你的嘴唇。我的心因你的笑容而融化。」我真誠地看著她。

「我的其他在你的眼裡還有價值嗎？」她試探性地問。

「我希望獨佔你的一切！」我毫不猶豫地回應。

「如果有一天我改變了，或許我會變得不再溫柔，不再美麗動人，當我只能羨慕別人的美貌時，你會離我而去嗎？」她直視著我的雙眼問。

「我曾答應過你，不會離開你的。」我沒有絲毫猶豫地回答，好像任何的遲疑都會成為反悔的證據。

「那你繼續騙我吧，我喜歡聽，我也願意。」她說著笑了笑。

然而，我卻覺得心裡很不舒服。雖然我不是故意要欺騙她，但她的話讓我意識到自己可能真的沒有認真考慮過這個問題。

「我真的沒騙你。」我忍不住反駁。

她只是輕輕地笑了笑，留下了那份空白申請書，打開了廚房的門。

我小心翼翼地收拾好表格，帶著切好的蛋糕跟了出去。

盡興的派對過後，打掃完畢，帶著疲倦的身軀倒下，卻無法立即入睡。

「為什麼說我騙她呢？明明我是真心的。」我不禁對著天花板發問。

好一番思索，卻得不出結論出來。有些頭疼，倦意襲來。

不知道過了多久，睜開眼睛，是個陽光明媚的早晨。

「我沒騙你。」我再次在心裡對自己說，然後深深吸了一口氣。我明白，愛是需要付出真心和努力的。我不能只是口頭上承諾，更要用實際行動去證明。我要珍惜凱晴，珍惜我們之間的感情，讓她知道，我的承諾是真摯的，是不會輕易改變的。

## 第二章
當我醒來時，發現自己躺在一個嶄新的床上，四周的一切都顯得那麼陌生。我試著回想過去的一切，但我的記憶似被清洗過一樣，一片空白。我的心跳加速，呼吸變得急促，我感到前所未有的恐慌。現在別說是要珍惜凱晴，我連自己是否還活著都不知道。

當我醒來時，發現自己躺在自己的床上，但是四周的一切都顯得那麼陌生。我試著回想過去的一切，但我的記憶似被清洗過一樣，一片空白。我的心跳加速，呼吸變得急促，我感到前所未有的恐慌。現在別說是要珍惜凱晴，我連自己是否還活著都不知道。

我摸索著起床，走到窗邊，試著透過窗戶找到一些線索。窗外是熟悉的風景。我無法回憶起任何事情，幾乎連自己的名字都想不起來，我無法理解究竟發生了什麼事情，我是誰，我在哪裡，為何在這裡？

轉過頭來，我發現桌上有一張照片，照片裡她的眼睛明亮，笑容溫暖，凱晴，我不可能認錯。突然間，我明白了：或許我與凱晴交換了身體。帶著這樣的認知，我開始在這個房間裡尋找可能的線索。

我翻開了衣櫥，裡面掛著的衣物對我來說完全陌生，只認得這件藍色的洋裝是她昨天穿的那款。接著，我走進廚房，面對滿櫃子的物品，卻記不起它們的名稱和使用方法。一種深深的絕望感湧上心頭，我不知道該怎麼辦。如果我真的是凱晴的話，那麼真正的凱晴又…

就在這時，電話響起，在客廳找到電話，電話那頭是梓軒的聲音。他對我說：「嗨，你好嗎？最近是否還沉浸在一心過世的事情？這一年大家都不好過，你已經在一心的家裡住了好些日子閉門不出，希望你不要總是獨自承擔。」

我心頭一震，我已經死了？但我以凱晴的身體活下來了？就是我的新生命。但我應該在生日之後又活了幾個月，之後又死了整年，我卻沒有記憶，這是怎麼回事情？自從我半年前死後凱晴就整天獨自在家。這或許是好事，至少我現在不需要擔心有人發現我的困境。還是說我該找人討論一下才對呢…

我蹲在地上，我不知道自己有沒有哭泣，但我能感覺到臉上有些濕濕的。不知道過了多久，終於覺得身體有些氣力，肚子開始餓起來。我拖著疲勞的身體到廚房找些東西吃，惟恐凱晴回來的時候發現自己的身體給我弄壞了，即使這是妄想，但這是現在能支撐我行動的唯一希望。

冰箱外有個貼紙，寫了一些意義不明的符號組合，不知道是什麼意思。找到了一些能吃的東西，吃完就發覺已經到了晚上。想到可能會有人來找我，我必須對凱晴的生活有更多了解，免得給人発覺不正常。我逐一打量起客廳裡的擺飾和物件，試著從中找到更多線索。但一切都那麼陌生，只讓我感到更加難受，每一様物件都提醒著我自己是一個外來者，我感到難以承擔，只想逃避一切。

我感覺精神彷彿被抽乾了，這一天已經發生了太多的事情，我已經昏頭轉向，什麼也不想理會了，只想回到床上，或許睡醒的時候一切都會恢復正常的，或者這是夢中的夢。

## 第三章
隔天清晨，當晨曦透過窗簾的縫隙灑進房間，我緩緩睜開雙眼，發現自己依舊身處我的臥室。這個曾經如此熟悉的房間如今卻變得異常陌生，讓我心頭湧上一陣莫名的迷茫。我知道，或許我還需要一段時間才能真正適應這一切，找回屬於自己的世界。在這段時間裡，我得盡力扮演好凱晴的角色，好讓凱晴回來自己身體的時候能夠順利融入環境。

望著窗外的烏雲密佈天空，我的心頭忽然沉甸甸的，靜靜地坐在那裡許久。直到一陣肚子咕嚕咕嚕的叫聲提醒了我，飢餓感像潮水般襲來。

我來到廚房和客廳，搜尋著能填飽肚子的東西。一份焦糖蛋糕瑞士捲出現在我的面前，儘管瑞士捲是我的最愛，但我嚐了一口後卻發現它的味道很不討喜，彷彿與我當前的處境相呼應。

環顧四周，狹小而溫馨的客廳充滿了回憶。環顧客廳，沙發，桌子，電視和櫃子。桌上空蕩蕩的《你的名字》光盤盒子，讓我想起了我們曾經計劃一起觀看這部電影的情景。也許這只是個夢，但顯然並非如此——我不可能不吃不喝一直活在一個夢中，至少我該會餓醒才對。

一本筆記本放在桌上，好奇心驅使我翻開閱讀。裡面的內容讓我震驚不已，對凱晴的思想實驗產生了深深的懷疑。我對她的文字感到無比陌生，對她關於「自我」的看法深感震撼，「自我」難道真的是一種欺騙？

筆記中寫道：「如果一個孤獨的人在隔絕的空間通過電話與人交談，他能根據日記賦予事物的意義以及在短暫對話中的感情流露表現出日記中的那個『自我』嗎？如果他能夠的話，那麼『自我』可能只是一個由四十九項訊息和感覺組合而成的錯覺。」或許我可以從這本子裡了解更多她的想法，對我目前的狀況有幫助。

筆記本的最後寫著：「既然自我受限於有限的理性，因此每次只能展現其一小部分，那麼一個吸收了這個人的過去經驗的人工智慧也能夠最大限度地還原這個人的自我，讓這個人永遠活在電腦世界裡。」那正在閱讀的我是否只是她用我的回憶重建的一個意識？她已經理解了意識的本質，而我其實只是一串訊息？我真的被自己欺騙了嗎？

思緒紛亂，我無法繼續沉浸其中。幸好我不是那種擅長深思的人，於是我將筆記本收起來，注意到封面上漂亮的蝴蝶結圖案，這本筆記本是我曾經送給凱晴的交換日記禮物。但為什麼沒有交換日記的內容，只留下了這些筆記？而且筆記本比當初給我的時候薄了很多，我想不明白其中的原因。

放下筆記本，我開始在房間裡四處探查，仔細檢查書桌、電腦和書櫃，希望能夠從中發現一些線索。由於不知道電腦密碼，我先開始找凱晴的日記。

我翻閱了凱晴的日記和書籍，驚訝地發現她對時間旅行和量子物理學有著濃厚的興趣。她似乎正在進行一項旨在改變過去的項目，試圖實現跨時空的意識交換，確切地說，是大腦意識訊息的交換。我的腦袋一陣發麻，忍不住用手搓揉。對於她的勇氣和毅力，我應該表達敬意，還是應該對自己看不懂那些複雜理論而感到憤怒？

就在這時，客廳的電話響了起來，是家輝打來的，他試圖帶給我一絲慰藉。

## 第四章
夜幕低垂，我漸漸習慣了眼前的一切。我如履薄冰地在周圍搜尋可能的線索，企圖揭開這場荒誕劇背後複雜的真相。儘管蒐集了大量資料，它們仍然像是散落的珍珠，無法編織成一個連貫的故事。身體的疲勞和精神的壓力如同無形的重擔，緊緊壓在我的肩上。

在家輝的問候中，我發現了他的關切和支持。他問我的近況，提到了我之前的練習：「好些了麼？前幾天你說話的方式好像不是自己一樣，你說是為了練習一心的說話方式，有什麼進展了嗎？」家輝的聲音溫和，幾乎讓人感覺到凱晴早已預料到我將以這種方式出現在這個地方，並為我的轉變做好了準備。

我陷入了沉思。凱晴將自己封閉在這個房間裡，很少外出，這正是她在筆記中所提到的透過電話與世界溝通的試驗。她是將自己的生命當作了一個實驗的對象嗎？那麼，現在的我究竟是誰？是一心，還是她透過我的日記建構出來的複製品？疑惑籠罩著我的心。

我回答：「嗯，我現在已經很流利了！」實際上，我根本不需要練習。

家輝提起我曾經的時光機項目，他說：「我記得你之前在做時間機器的項目，希望可以拯救那段錯過的愛情。」

「嗯嗯，我剛剛在讀自己的筆記。」

「啊，我可以來探望你嗎？你前幾天說有突破性的進展了，可惜我之前在忙……你知道，家裡人想你去看看精神病專科……我要去幫你安排那些手續，我知道，你是想確保治療不會影響到你的研究，我是支持你的」聽到家輝的關懷，我心頭一緊，更加理解了凱晴為何如此渴望改變過去，為何如此投入量子物理的研究，或許有的事情一放下就再也拿不起了。

「呃，我……」面對這種局面，我毫無對策，只得找個理由假裝生病，試圖掩蓋自己的困境，「我……我感覺不太舒服，不想見人。」

「我帶你去醫生那裡嗎？」

「不用了，我心裡累了，只想安靜一會兒。」

「那……我就不打擾你了。不過你可能沒收到訊息，過幾天家裡就會回來香港，然後他們會帶你去看精神科。」家輝告訴我。

掛斷電話後，我心中的憂慮愈發加重。我害怕一旦我坦言真實身份，會沒有人願意相信自己，會否讓大家更誤解我的處境。如果有一天我回到了原來的世界，而凱晴又回到了這裡，她會怎麼面對這一切？我必須更加小心，更努力地扮演好凱晴的角色，這不僅是為了我自己，也是為了她。

我試著翻閱書架上找到的書：《偶像的黃昏》、《擬像論》、《自私的基因》、《社會學的想像》、《想像的共同體》。它們的標題看起來高深莫測，大部分對我來說都是晦澀難懂的。不知不覺間，我抱著書本在地板上沉沉睡去。醒來，在地板上睡過然還是有些不舒服，我瞥見了床下的神祕箱子，但並沒有深入探究，迅速地爬到床上，又再沉沉睡去。

直到破曉時分，我又一次在床上迎來了新的一天。

## 第五章

今天已經是來到這裡的第三天，窗外淅淅雨聲讓我稍微放鬆，我整理了地上那些深奧的書籍，接著翻開了凱晴的日記，在其中找到了她在一心意外離世後開始研發時間機的線索。梓軒來電，語氣中透著對凱晴的憐憫和對她近況的關注。我盡量保持鎮定，只在談話中提及日記裡記錄的凱晴過往回憶，偽裝成凱晴的樣子，想讓梓軒覺得我似乎已經開始釋懷，不再是那樣執著於完成時間機。

我想在電腦中尋找更多信息，但卻不知道密碼。一邊嘗試輸入各種可能的密碼組合，一邊思索有沒有別的方法可以解鎖。突然，我的視線落在門口。記得曾經在冰箱上看過一組我看不懂的文字。我立刻跑向冰箱，找到那一組字母，並在電腦上依序輸入，果然是正確的密碼。電腦發出嘟嘟聲，成功地登入了。我興奮極了，因為我現在可以查閱凱晴以前的瀏覽器歷史和筆記了。

我發現了一系列網頁，上面記載著一些我從未接觸過的概念和技術。我試圖在文章裡找出關鍵詞並翻查百科書網站來盡可能地了解情況。原來，凱晴並未完成時間機的設計，反而證明了量子遙感的限制及其理論基礎。根據量子遙感的原理，她試圖向時間線的前後發射信號，但沒有辦法確保接收信號的對象，最終以特定的大腦神經結構作為接收裝置以確保接收對象，結果創造出了一種傳送意識的機械。凱晴或許是將自己的意識發送到過去改變了什麼，也許是正因為這種對過去時空的干預，導致我出現在這裡，我們在時空發展的直線上打了一個手扣結啊，誰知道對整個時空有什麼影響，萬一永無止境地陷入循環怎麼辦？

我突然感到恐懼，這種恐懼和之前對自己處境可能的恐懼有些不同，是空虛、遙遠的一種隱隱約約的不安，好像我做了什麼天大的壞事但好在沒有人知道。當務之急我必須要設法找到控制台，然後再看看有沒有可能修復凱晴製造的時空混亂，重返自己的生活，凱晴的筆記真是好幫手，或許她早就預料到我會試圖尋找回去的辦法所以一直在引導我。但我也不得不同情凱晴，如果凱晴所做的一切是為了讓那個世界裡的我和她一起，如果我啟動裝置，是否會破壞她的計劃？或許我應該在這個世界裡用她的身分活下去才是最好的選擇？這個時候，最需要神靈指引的時候，它卻不顯靈。

或許只要去過精神科，大家也不會懷疑我的奇怪，我定居在這裡似乎不是不行。

我感覺到自己的注意力越來越分散，身體也越來越疲憊。我意識到自己需要休息一下，於是我走進廚房，打開冰箱，拿出一個蘋果和一杯牛奶。簡單的食物讓我感到舒適滿足。我坐在餐桌上，慢慢地享用這些美食，也讓我的思維得以放鬆。隨後，我放棄了思考。

吃完飯後，我回到臥室，躺在床上。關掉了燈，讓房間變得更昏暗。閉上眼睛，我讓自己沉浸在黑暗中，雨聲包圍著我，一股輕鬆平靜的氛圍。我的呼吸變得越來越深沉平穩。

我不知道自己究竟睡了多久，但當我再次睜開眼睛時，房間已經亮堂起來。我覺得精力充沛，頭腦清醒。在恢復了精力和清晰的思考能力之後，我回到了電腦前，繼續查閱筆記。這次，我的思路更加清晰，能夠專注地閱讀和理解其中的內容。

筆記中提到了《arXiv：量子系統；不可計算》，我研究了很久也不明白，這似乎是一種複雜的數學理論。為什麼筆記中說單憑個人的視角永遠不會做出最佳選擇？為什麼即使有了量子計算機，個人也不可能在當下預測兩個人的未來？那或許我們需要的不是預測而是溝通──即使不是最好的選擇，卻是我們願意為之承擔後果的選擇？

我突然意識到，我一直以來可能只是在用自己的觀點看待問題，而沒有試著從她的角度來看事情。我體認到自己可能給凱晴帶來了不必要的困擾和痛苦。我希望自己能夠更專注於他人的感受和需求。或許她說我騙她的意思就是我並沒有認真考慮承擔後果而單憑幻想和預測的美夢做決定？

再次躺下，我感到身體和精神都非常疲憊。我的思緒圍繞著過去的行動和想法旋轉，讓我感到極不舒服。

我開始深呼吸，試著讓自己的身體和思考放鬆。閉上眼睛，專注於呼吸，我意識到需要接受自己的過去，從中學習經驗和教訓。我開始設想從這個經驗中學到的寶貴教訓，例如更重視他人的感受和需求，並且學會換位思考。

這些想法讓我感到更加平和安寧。我逐漸意識到，過去的事已經發生，而現在我需要做的就是從中學習成長，變得更成熟、更有智慧。最終，我慢慢進入了夢鄉。

## 第六章
第四天，冰箱裡的食物消耗殆盡，我打開了冷凍櫃，期待著能找到些什麼可解凍的東西。沒想到，卻在角落發現了一個奇怪的儲存裝置。看起來它是可以連接到電腦的。

當我深入研究這個儲存裝置內的文件時，我才了解到它的秘密。原來這就是關於那台傳說中能夠傳送意識的機器的操作說明。

「找到了這份文件，那就按照說明把自己送回原來的世界吧……」文件裡寫著，但是我疑惑了，不知道是不是應該啟動床下的那個裝置，我不知道為什麼要留在這個世界，也不知道為什麼應該回到原來的世界。我不知道正確的選擇，但我還記得自己希望讓那個世界的她知道，我的承諾是真摯的。不知道這樣有沒有道理去破壞這個世界的她正在做的事情。

終於依照文檔上的指引，緩緩開啟了箱子，啟動了那個裝置…

當我再次醒來時，我發現自己躺在屬於我的房間裡。書桌上多了一本筆記本，上面清晰地記敘著今天的行程，這讓我感到既好奇又詭異。我開始翻閱本子的其餘頁面，發現每天都會寫下一連串的行為和即將發生的事件。第一頁的解釋表明，作者是出於擔心我突然回歸原本的身體時會感到無所適從，特意準備了這本說明書。筆記上有撕掉的痕跡，或許之前每天也都有說明，以防我突然決定要啟動裝置並且歸來。

我感覺自己是受到了特別的關懷，心跳加速，同時也為自己的疏忽感到內疚。離開了那個世界卻沒有留下任何說明，這是多麼不該有的事。

我能感覺到背脊上輕輕的刺刺的感覺蔓延開來，驚訝和困惑同時纏繞著我，但也有一絲奇妙的安全感。因為我知道，透過查看這本子，我可以把握住當前的情況，不會迷失方向或作出錯誤的決定。

當我看到筆記本上寫著下午將與凱晴舉辦婚禮的消息時，我先是感到一陣激動，緊接著又是無盡的糾結。我不知道該怎麼辦，因為這牽涉到要不要假裝成這段時間的自己參加婚禮。我想起了那份筆記中的一句話：「既然自我受限於有限理性，因此每次只能展現其一部分，那麼無法完全且準確為人所探知的真正的'自己'並不是關係互動中最需要被重視的？

似乎她也在這段科幻電影般的經歷中獲得了新的啟發。我拿出自己的日記，看到裡面有兩種不同的字體，新增部分的字體整潔清晰：「人們是透過想像的未來相連，當下的真實並不決定未來，人們經常從錯誤的開始創造追求的結局」。但最後幾段關於婚禮的字跡顯得猶豫不決，畢竟，這對凱晴來說婚禮是她期待的，但以我的身份參與似乎不是她所追求的事情。她寫道：「人們的感情是會改變的，對未來期許和規劃的維係是維持關係並推動變化的基礎」。

這些都讓我開始反思關係的變遷，我意識到這是一種選擇和承擔。我決定接受這個世界的現實，勇敢面對婚禮和凱晴。我會帶著真誠的態度參加婚禮，盡我所能維繫我們的關係。因為我知道，選擇和行動是我們生活中最重要的一部分，而我所要做的，就是勇敢地做出選擇，並承擔後果。隨著我逐漸理解這個世界的運作方式，我也發現自己的能力和智慧不斷增長，這使得我更有自信地迎接未來的挑戰。

於是我穿上最好的衣服，準備好前往婚禮現場。我走進了會場…

在我的世界裡，事故並未發生，時間線沒有陷入繩結的循環，我繼續不斷地成長和進步。我學會瞭如何應對各種挑戰和困難，並在這個世界上找到了自己的定位和使命。我感謝那個世界的她，因為她讓我認識到了生命中真正重要的事物，並幫助我成為了一個更好的人。
